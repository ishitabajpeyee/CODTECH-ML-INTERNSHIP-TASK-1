# DECISION TREE IMPLEMENTATION
This repository contains an implementation and visualization of a Decision Tree model using Scikit-learn. The model is designed to classify and predict outcomes on a chosen car dataset.
Features-
1. Build a Decision Tree classifier using Scikit-learn
2. Visualize the structure of the decision tree
3. Evaluate model performance
4. Easily customizable to work with different datasets
   
Model Overview-
A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning model used for classification and regression tasks. It splits data into branches to predict an output label or value based on input features.
